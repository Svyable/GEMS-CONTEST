# Generative AI disclosure log

The GEMS official rules allow generative AI in solution development but require competitors to disclose the extent and manner of its use in the submission narrative.

Keep this file factual and current.

## 2026-09-22 — repository bootstrap

OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5.6 Sol) was used to:

- research and summarize the public competition description, metric, submission format, official rules, and public organizer clarifications;
- create the initial repository structure and documentation;
- draft reusable Python utilities for the published distance-weighted Tversky metric and GeoTIFF submission validation;
- propose an experiment and modeling strategy.

Competition data was not supplied to the model during this bootstrap. All generated code is subject to local tests, human review, empirical validation, and the competitor's responsibility for accuracy/authorship representations.

## 2026-09-22 — provenance, CV, and reference-baseline tooling

OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5.6 Sol) was used to:

- inspect the public organizer reference-solution repository and transcribe its published U-Net parameters;
- identify and document the filename discrepancy between the public problem page and reference notebook;
- implement deterministic SHA256/raster-metadata manifests for local data provenance;
- implement buffered spatial-block folds and complete connected-fault holdouts;
- add tests and a CLI that produces fold rasters and JSON summaries for reproducible validation.

No gated competition data was provided to the model during this work. The generated validation design is our experimental methodology, not an organizer-provided scoring implementation, and must be checked empirically once the real rasters are available.

## 2026-09-22 — executable organizer-baseline reproduction

OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5.6 Sol) was used to:

- inspect the public organizer notebook's full patch-splitting and Monte Carlo training cells;
- implement a NumPy-tested reproduction of its patch selection, normalization, padding, and OOF assembly;
- implement a PyTorch/segmentation-models-pytorch CLI for reproducing the published U-Net baseline once gated data is available;
- document deliberate reproducibility/output-format fixes that differ from the notebook's incidental behavior.

No gated competition data was supplied to the model, and no reference training run has yet been claimed as reproduced.

For each material use, record date, tool/model, what information was provided, what was generated, and what verification was performed before relying on the output.
